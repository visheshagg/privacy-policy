<h1>Account and Data Deletion Instructions</h1>

<p>These instructions refer to the <strong>CampusKart - Everything College</strong> app, developed by <strong>Vishesh Aggarwal</strong>. We are committed to respecting your privacy and providing a clear process for you to delete your account and associated personal data.</p>

<h2>Steps to Request Account Deletion</h2>

    <li>Recipient: Address the email to our dedicated support address: <strong><a href="mailto:visheshaggarwal1708@gmail.com">visheshaggarwal1708@gmail.com</a></strong>.</li>
    <li>Subject Line: The subject line <strong>must</strong> be: <strong><code>Urgent Account and Data Deletion Request</code></strong>.</li>
    <li>Body Content: In the body of the email, clearly state your:
        <ul>
            <li>Full Name</li>
            <li>CampusKart Username/Email</li>
            <li>Explicit Confirmation that you wish to permanently delete your account and all associated personal data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Types Deleted and Kept</h2>

<p>Upon receiving a valid request, Vishesh Aggarwal will process the permanent deletion of your account and most personal data within <strong>30 days</strong>.</p>

            <td><strong>Retained (for a period)</strong></td>
            <td>We may be required to keep financial transaction data (if applicable, e.g., purchase receipts) for legal or tax compliance purposes for the period required by law. This retained data will no longer be linked to your deleted user account.</td>
